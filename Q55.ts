
// Question 55: Double Numbers in an Array: Make a list of numbers. Then, use a trick to make a new list where each number is twice its original value.

// Starts with a list of numbers
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Doubles each number
let doubledNumbers = numbers.map(number => number * 2);

// Shows the new list of doubled numbers
console.log(doubledNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
// This line takes each number, doubles it, and puts it in a new list.
