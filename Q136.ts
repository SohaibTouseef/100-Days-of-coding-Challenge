// Question 136: Use console.log() to debug and track the value of a variable inside a loop.

// Demonstrates using console.log() inside a loop to track variable values
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    console.log(`Iteration ${i}, i value:, i`); // Logs the current iteration number and the value of i
  }
  // This loop iterates five times, logging the value of 'i' during each iteration to help with debugging.
