//20. Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.


let languages : string [] = ['English','Urdu','hindi','french','arabic']
console.log("list of languages:")
for(let top of languages){
    console.log(top)
}
