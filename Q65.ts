
// Question 65: Determine the Remainder: Make a function that gets two numbers and shows the leftover from dividing them using the % sign. For example, remainder(5, 2) should give 1.


// This function finds the leftover of dividing two numbers
function remainder(num1: number, num2: number): number {
    // Gives back the leftover of num1 divided by num2
    return num1 % num2;
}

// Trying it with 5 divided by 2
console.log(remainder(5, 2)); // Shows 1
// This tells us the leftover, which is 1 here.
