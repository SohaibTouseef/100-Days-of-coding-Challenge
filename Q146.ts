
// Question 146: Show an example of a callback function used to filter an array of numbers.

// Explain & TIP: The .filter() method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function. This method is commonly used to search through an array and create a subset of it based on certain criteria.

// This array of numbers will be filtered
const numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

// Uses .filter() with a callback function to filter out numbers greater than 5
const filteredNumbers: number[] = numbers.filter((number) => number > 5);

console.log(filteredNumbers); // Outputs: [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
// The callback function here checks each number, and .filter() creates a new array with numbers that meet the criteria.
