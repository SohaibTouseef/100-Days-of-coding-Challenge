// Question 53: Pulling Apart a Nested Object: Imagine you have a list inside another list that shows what a computer programmer knows, like coding languages, tools, and software frameworks. Find a way to get three specific skills from this list and show them.

// A list showing a programmer's skills in detail

let developerSkills = {
  languages: ["JavaScript", "TypeScript", "Python"],
  frameworks: ["React", "Angular", "Vue"],
  tools: ["Git", "Webpack", "Docker"],
};

// Getting specific skills from the list
let { languages, frameworks, tools } = developerSkills;

// Showing a skill from each category
console.log(
  `Language: ${languages[0]}, Framework: ${frameworks[0]}, Tool: ${tools[0]}`
);
