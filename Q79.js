// Question 79: Creating and Accessing Object Properties: Construct an object representing a car with properties for make, model, and year. Then, show how you can access the model property of the car.
// This sets up an object for a car with specific details
let car = {
    make: "Toyota",
    model: "Corolla",
    year: 2020
};
// Accessing and showing the car's model
console.log(car.model); // Outputs: Corolla
// We use dot notation (car.model) to get the model of the car from our object.
