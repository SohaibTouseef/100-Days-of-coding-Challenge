// Explain & TIP: setTimeout() is a built-in JavaScript function that allows you to execute a piece of code after a specified delay. It's especially useful for scheduling tasks, animations, or delaying execution without blocking the main thread.


// Uses setTimeout to log a message after a 2-second delay
setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("This message is shown after a 2-second delay.");
  }, 2000);
  // This showcases how to use setTimeout to delay actions in your code.
